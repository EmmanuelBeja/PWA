        <h2>Grey Wolf</h3>
          <img src="assets/img/greywolves.jpeg" alt="Grey Wolf" class="img img-thumbnail img-responsive" style="width:100%">
         <p>
           Wolves are legendary because of their spine-tingling howl, which they use to communicate. A lone wolf howls to attract the attention of his pack, while communal howls may send territorial messages from one pack to another. Some howls are confrontational. Much like barking domestic dogs, wolves may simply begin howling because a nearby wolf has already begun.
         </p>

         <h2>Red Wolf</h2>
         <img src="assets/img/redwolf.jpg" alt="Red Wolf" class="img img-thumbnail img-responsive" style="width:100%">
         <p>
           The red wolf (Canis lupus rufus or Canis rufus) also known as the Florida black wolf or Mississippi Valley wolf, is a canid native to the southeastern United States of unresolved taxonomic identity. Morphologically it is intermediate between the coyote and gray wolf, and is of a reddish, tawny color. The Red Wolf is a federally listed endangered species of the United States and is protected by law. It has been listed by IUCN as a critically endangered species since 1996. It is considered the rarest species of wolf and is one of the five most endangered species of canid in the world
         </p>

         <h2>Eastern Wolf</h2>
         <img src="assets/img/easternwolf.jpg" alt="Eastern Wolf" class="img img-thumbnail img-responsive" style="width:100%">
         <p>
           The eastern wolf (Canis lupus lycaon or Canis c.f. lycaon), also known as the Algonquin wolf or Great Lakes wolf, is a canid native to the northeastern side of North America's Great Lakes region as well as southeastern Canada. It is a medium-sized canid which, like the red wolf, is intermediate in size between the coyote and the gray wolf. It primarily preys on white-tailed deer, but may occasionally attack moose and beavers. They also prey on muskrats and mice.
         </p>

         <h2>Mexican Wolf</h2>
         <img src="assets/img/mexicanwolf.jpg" alt="Mexican Wolf" class="img img-thumbnail img-responsive" style="width:100%">
         <p>
           The Mexican wolf (Canis lupus baileyi), also known as the lobo, is a subspecies of gray wolf once native to southeastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, western Texas and northern Mexico. It is the smallest of North America's gray wolves, and is similar to C. l. nubilus, though it is distinguished by its smaller, narrower skull and its darker pelt, which is yellowish-gray and heavily clouded with black over the back and tail. Its ancestors were likely the first gray wolves to enter North America after the extinction of the Beringian wolf, as indicated by its southern range and basal physical and genetic characteristics
         </p>

         <h2>Arctic Wolf</h2>
         <img src="assets/img/arcticwolf.jpg" alt="Arctic Wolf" class="img img-thumbnail img-responsive" style="width:100%">
         <p>
           The Arctic wolf (Canis lupus arctos), also known as the white wolf or polar wolf, is a subspecies of gray wolf native to the Queen Elizabeth Islands, from Melville Island to Ellesmere Island. It is a medium-sized subspecies, distinguished from the northwestern wolf by its smaller size, its whiter coloration, its narrower braincase, and larger carnassials. Since 1930, there has been a progressive reduction in size in Arctic wolf skulls, which is likely the result of wolf-dog hybridization
